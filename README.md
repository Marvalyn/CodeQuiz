# CodeQuiz

## Description
This app is a timed multiple-choice quiz that runs in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

When you click the start button, a timer starts and you are presented with a question. After answering this question you are presented with another question. If you answer a question incorrectly 10 seconds is subtracted from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over. You are then redirected to the highscores page where you can save your initials and score. Clicking the "highscores" button will take you to a leaderboard with previous user scores. Clicking "clear highscores" will erase the leaderboard.
